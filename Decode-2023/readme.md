<h1>Welcome to MOSIP Decode — the first edition of MOSIP’s virtual hackathon!</h1>

As an open source project for national digital identity systems, we are committed to creating space for contributions from software developers around the world. We invite you to join the larger initiative driving digital transformation, and engage in problem solving for one of the world's most critical issues — the lack of legal, verifiable digital identity and its application for equitable access to rights and services.

Being a globally recognised Digital Public Good, MOSIP strives to create inclusive and trustworthy digital identity systems for rapidly developing countries. Our team works tirelessly with local experts to customise our technology to suit a population’s requirements, but these needs are diverse and have endless potential for solutions.

This is where <b>MOSIP Decode</b> comes in.

Our hackathon gives you the opportunity to contribute solutions for national digital infrastructure that is currently being implemented in over 10 countries. Develop code that aligns with MOSIP’s guiding principles of modularity, scalability, security, privacy, and open standards, and join our mission of empowering lives around the world, one unique ID at a time.
